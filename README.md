New Elysium is a large Minecraft modpacks focused on automation and transhumanism.

The pack is mainly influenced by the Celldweller's music, movies like Blade Runner or Star Wars, the Neuromencer book and others Minecraft modpacks like GT New Horizons or FTB Interactions.

The pack has around 250 mods and benefits of a huge configuration to reduce item redundancy (no more 15 types of furnaces or 30 types of cables...), homogenize the recipes and the uses of the machines.

In addition, the pack has a complete overhaul of the appearance. Most of the menus are color changed, there is a custom loading screen with extra informations and a beautifull main menu with dynamics informations.

The pack has a large quest line to guide your progression and teach you how to use most of the modpack's mods.
